# Advent-of-code-2024
Trying 25 different programming languages 


## THE DAYS:
DAY1: Racket (Bad tooling, vscode ext didn't work. Felt like worse haskell)

DAY2: Kotlin (Bad tooling, only got autocomplete partially to work on intellij community edition)

DAY3: Python (Good tooling in vscode)

DAY4: Rust (VERY good tooling in vscode)

DAY5: Haskell (OK tooling, hlint is good, ormolu works)

DAY6: Go (Very good tooling, monkey-level language) 

DAY7: Ocaml (Nice tooling, but annoying stdlib, good formatter)

DAY8: C 

DAY9: Jai (Has syntax highlighting at least)

DAY10: C# (Boring language)
